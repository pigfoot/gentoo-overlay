		If you like the interface of HTTPie but miss the features
		of curl, curlie is what you are searching for.

		Curlie is a frontend to curl that adds the ease of use of
		httpie, without compromising on features and performance.

		All curl options are exposed with syntax sugar and output
		formatting inspired from httpie.
